A quik guide on how to use the PyActor library through examples.


.. _first:

First steps:
============

This library allows the creation and management of actors in a distributed system using Python.
The core of the library is implemented in the three modules explained in this page. That contains
the actors, the proxys that allows them to be accessed from remote locations and the hosts that
put it all together.

First of all, a :class:`~.context.Host` is needed in order to create some actors. To create a host, use the
function :func:`~.context.init_host` which returns the proxy of a host. Then, use this proxy to spawn
actors by giving the class type of the actor to create. The :meth:`~.context.Host.spawn` method will return the proxy (:class:`~.proxy.Proxy`)
that manages that actor, but you will need to use the *.get()* to obtain it from the Future created for the query when called
the :meth:`~.context.Host.spawn` which is actualy an ask method of the host actor. See example::

    h = init_host()
    actor1 = h.spawn('id1',MyClass).get()

The class of an actor must have defined its methods in the _tell and _ask lists so they can be called through the proxy.
In the _tell list will be named those methods meant to be asynchronous and in the _ask list, the synchronous ones.
In this example we have a class MyClass with a sync method *ask_me()* and an async method *tell_me()*::

    class MyClass:
        _tell =['tell_me']
        _ask = ['ask_me']
        def tell_me(self,msg):
            print msg
        def ask_me(self):
            return 'hello back'

As you can see, the async method recieves a message and simply prints it while the sync method returns a result.
More basic examples can be found in the 'pyactor/examples' directory of the project: sample1.py, sample2.py, sample3.py and sample4.p.
They are also explained below.

-- _sample1:

Sample 1
============

This example shows and tests the most basic elements of this library. It creates a :class:`~.Host` and adds an actor to it.
Then, queries an async method of this actor. This is the full code of this sample, which you can find and test in
``pyactor\examples\sample1.py``:

.. literalinclude:: ..\examples\sample1.py
    :linenos:

This example is similar to the one shown above in :ref:`first`, but here we'll explain it more carefully.

In this case, we need to import the :func:`~.init_host` function from the project in order to use it.
We also import the *sleep* function to give time to the actor to work.

The actor to create in this example will be an :class:`Echo`. This class only has one method which prints
the message *msg*, given by parameter. As you can see, the classes destinated to be actors must have below
his definition the statements ``_tell=[]`` and ``_ask=[]`` that include the names of the methods that can be
remotely invoked in an asynchronous or synchronous way, respectively. In this sample we have the echo method,
which is async, as no response from it is needed.

To begin the execution we'll need a :class:`~.Host` to contain the actors. For that, we create a new variable
by using the function we imported before. ::

    h = init_host()

Now we have a :class:`~.Host` in the 'h' variable. It can create actors atached to itself. To do that, we use
the :meth:`~.Host.spawn` method. The first parameter is a string with the id of the actor that will identifie it
among the host so no repeated values allowed. The second is the class the actor will be instance of. In this case
we create an actor which will be an :class:`Echo` and with the id 'echo1'::

    e1 = h.spawn('echo1',Echo).get()

The use of *.get()* at the end is necessary since 'h' is actually a reference to the :class:`Proxy` of the host
that acts like an actor and :meth:`~.spawn` is treated like an async method which result has to be obtained.
'e1' will now represent that actor (the :class:`Proxy` that manages it).

As we have the actor, we can invoke his methods as we would do normally since the proxy will redirect the queries
to the actual ubication of it. If we didn't have specified the methods in the statements appointed before (_tell and _ask),
we would't be able to do this now.
The execution shold work properly and print on screen::

    hello there !!

Then, the sleep gives time to the actor for doing the work and finall, we close the host, which will stop all
its actors. This function (:meth:`~.shutdown`) should be allways called at the end::

    h.shutdown()

.. note:: The host is actualy an actor itself, so it can recieve remote queries and has sync and async methods.

.. _sample2:

Sample 2
============

This example extends the content of the previous one by including sync queries. It still creates a :class:`~.Host`
and adds an actor to it. This is the full code of this sample, which you can find and test in
``pyactor\examples\sample2.py``:

.. literalinclude:: ..\examples\sample2.py
    :linenos:

Now :class:`Echo` has two new methods, :meth:`bye` and :meth:`say_something`. The first one is async like
the previous :meth:`echo`, but the other one is synchronous.

In this example we see that, when invoking a synchronous method is needed to add the *.get()* in order to actually
execute the method and obtain a result from it. If you forget to use it, the function will return a :class:`~.Future`
which is a the formulation of the query, but it has not been invoked yet.

The correct output for this sample is the following::

    hello there !!
    bye
    something


.. _sample3:

Sample 3
=================

This example tries the functionality of the callback element of the synchronous queries. This is the full code of this
sample, which you can find and test in ``pyactor\examples\sample3.py``:

.. literalinclude:: ..\examples\sample3.py
    :linenos:

This time we keep having the same initialitzation as before, but now threre is a new class. :class:`Bot` has three async
methods that will allow to prove the correctness of the callback functionality. :meth:`set_echo` registers an :class:`Echo`
to the Bot so it can call it. :math:`ping` creates the query to the :meth:`say_something` method and sets the callback for this
to his other method :meth:`pong`. This second will recieve the result of the execution of the :meth:`say_something` method.

.. note:: :meth:`~.add_callback` needs to be called from an actor to another actor, specifing a method of the first one that has
    one parameter, which will be the result of the method invoked.

The correct output for this sample is the following::

    pinging...
    callback something

.. _sample4:

Sample 4
=================

This example tests the raising of timeouts. This is the full code of this sample, which you can find and test in
``pyactor\examples\sample4.py``:

.. literalinclude:: ..\examples\sample4.py
    :linenos:

Now we have the same :class:`Echo` class but in the sync method we added a sleep of 2 seconds. Also, we sorrounded
the call of the method by a try structure catching a :class:`~.Timeout` exception. Since we are giving to the invocation
a expire time of 1 second, the timeout will be reached and the exception rised.

.. note:: The parameter of the .get() method is the time, in seconds, that is given as a timeout to the querie. The
    default one, in case none is specified, is 1 second.

The correct output for this sample is the following::

    hello there !!
    bye
    timeout catched


.. _sample5:

Sample 5
=================

This example tests the reference to actors id and proxy. This is the full code of this sample, which you can find and test in
``pyactor\examples\sample5.py``:

.. literalinclude:: ..\examples\sample5.py
    :linenos:

This sample demonstrates how to get references from an actor. With ``e1.id`` we obtain the string that identifies
the actor in the host it is located.
Then, with ``e1.get_proxy()`` you can get a reference to a new proxy managing the same actor so you can give it to
another function, class or module.

.. note:: If you actually want the same proxy instance, 'e1' whould do.

The correct output for this sample is the following::

    echo1
    hello there !!
    bye
    echo1
    something

In this sample, we also see the usage of the :func:`~.serve_forever` function wich is very useful in remote communication
in order to keep a host alive as another one send queries to his actors. The usage is very simple, instead of shuting
the host down at the end, we call::

    serve_forever()

This will maintain the host alive in lower process consumption until the user presses ``Ctrl+C``.


.. _sample6:

Sample 6
=========

This example shows the usage of the lookup methods applied to a host. This is the full code of this sample, which
you can find and test in ``pyactor\examples\sample6.py``:

.. literalinclude:: ..\examples\sample6.py
    :linenos:

We have two ways to get the reference of one already existing actor of a host. If it is local, of the same host,
it is fine to use the method :meth:`~.lookup` giving by parameter only the id of the actor you wish::

    e = h.lookup('echo1').get()

If you are working remotly, you could need :meth:`~.lookup_url` to get the reference. In this example, it is used
also to get a local reference giving the standard local url at which the host is initialized by default::

    ee = h.lookup_url('local://local:6666/echo1', Echo).get()

This second way, requieres also to specify the class of the actor to lookup in the second parameter.
